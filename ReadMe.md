Lesson 01: Basic Print in python

Lesson 02: 

    Language Models (Language models help computers predict the likelihood of a sequence of words.)
    Sequences 

        Predicting a sequence of words can be pretty helpful for everyday tasks, such as:

        📝 Text Generation: Creating natural-sounding sentences and paragraphs.
        🔍 Text Classification: Categorizing text into defined groups, like spam vs. non-spam emails.
        🗣️ Machine Translation: Translating text from one language to another, like English to Spanish.
        🚩 Spell Check: Finding and correcting spelling errors in text.
        We'll dive into these tasks in the upcoming exercises!
